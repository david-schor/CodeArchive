 * Synopsis:
 *              size_t strlen(const char *s);
 *
 * Description:
 *              The strlen function computes the length of the string pointed
 *              to by s.
 *
 * Returns:
 *              The strlen function returns the number of characters that precede
 *              the terminating null character.
